The resistor of the USB shield should be 0603.
There's no need for pullup on D+.
There is no need for pullup on RESET_N.
The pinout of the chrystals are rotated 90 degrees.
There should be a jumper instead of a pulldown resistor at PA13.
The footprint of the isolator is mirrored.
LEAD_TEST1 and INT_AD need to be swapped.
The USB connection needs a bit more space and two pads for the shield.
