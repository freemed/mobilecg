## About

MobilECG is an USB-based **open source 12-lead clinical electrocardiograph**. It is designed to meet all the relevant medical standards (ISO 60601-1, etc.). Smaller than most ECGs on the market, and also has superior signal quality. Works with PCs, notebooks, and Android tablets. Records all leads simultaneously. Manufacturing cost @ 1000 pieces: ~$110 (based on real quotes).

## Open Source

You can download the hardware design, firmware, and software source code for free:

* Schematic and printed circuit board (KiCAD)
* Firmware (for both microcontrollers)
* Driver library (Linux, OSX and Windows)
* wxWidgets test application (Linux, OSX and Windows)
* Android test application - not available yet

The software is licensed under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/txt/copying/), the hardware under [CERN OHL 1.2](http://www.ohwr.org/licenses/cern-ohl/v1.2). There is no warranty, and I have no liability for anything related to mobilECG. Only put the electrodes on people if you are 100% confident in what you are doing.

Note: the design is functional (see the gallery below) but unfinished, it needs additional work before it can be certified. There are also some known bugs in it. Most of the software is unimplemented. If you have questions, contact me at peter dоt isza аt gmail dоt com.
